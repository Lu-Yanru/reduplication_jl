Introduction
In Mandarin Chinese, verbs can be reduplicated to express a delimitative
aspectual meaning (e.g. Chao 1968: 204–205; Li & Thompson 1981: 232;
Li 1996: 14; Dai 1997: 70; Zhu 1998: 382–383; F. Xing 2000: 420–421;
Q. Chen 2001: 48; Tsao 2001: 288; Yang 2003: 11–12; Xiao & McEnery
2004: Sec. 4.3). This means that the event or state denoted by the verb
happens in a short duration and/or a low frequency (Xiao & McEnery 2004:
155), such as illustrated in (1).1 Thus, verbal reduplication in Mandarin
Chinese is often translated as doing something “a little bit/for a little
while”.

The current study tries to determine a suitable formal and unified
analysis for the structure of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese.
It contributes more empirical evidence and offers a novel analysis in the
theoretical framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG;
Pollard & Sag 1994, Sag 1997, Müller et al. 2021) to this phenomenon using
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake et al. 2005) as the semantic

representation formalism. This new account of reduplication avoids the
problems of previous approaches and explains more forms of deliminative
verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese.
This paper is organized as follows: after this introduction, we will
present in Section 2 the forms and syntactic distribution as well as the
semantics of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. Importantly, we
restrict the object of this study to the AA, A-yi-A, A-le-A, A-le-yi-A,
ABAB and AB-le-AB forms of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese.
We will also discuss in this section, with the help of corpus data, the
question of whether the reduplication is better analyzed as a morphological
or a syntactic process. In Section 3, we will discuss the advantages and
drawbacks of previous approaches. Section 4 will present a new HPSG
account for verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. Finally, Section 5
will conclude the paper.
The data in this paper was drawn from several sources. In addition to
introspection, the Modern Chinese subcorpus of the corpus of the Center
for Chinese Linguistics of Peking University (CCL; Zhan et al. 2003, 2019)
and the BCC corpus (Xun et al. 2016) were also consulted. Further,
examples from novels and plays written by native speakers were considered.
Corpus data provides natural and contextualized examples, and contains
a variation of linguistic properties (Meurers & Müller 2009: 921). This
can help us discover relevant constraints that can otherwise go unnoticed
through introspection.
The phenomenon
This section introduces the fundamental grammatical behaviors of verbal
reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. After illustrating its forms, syntactic
distribution and semantics, we discuss the questions of whether it is better
analyzed as a morphological or a syntactic phenomenon.
Forms
There is no general agreement on the forms of verbal reduplication in
Mandarin Chinese. We adopt a broad definition in terms of the forms of
verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese and list in (2)–(4) all the forms
commonly discussed in the literature.

One reviewer points out that this form is not acceptable for him/her. The
acceptability of the A-kàn-kàn form seems to vary among Mandarin Chinese
speakers. Cheng (2012: 73) suggests that unlike AA-kàn, A-kàn-kàn is an emerging
construction that is still undergoing grammaticalization. He found in the Academia
Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese (Sinica Corpus; Huang & Chen 1998)
23 tokens of A-kàn-kàn but 141 tokens of AA-kàn (p. 64). This shows that the
former is less common than the latter. (2a) below is an example of A-kàn-kàn from
the Sinica Corpus.

Cheng’s (2012) study is based on the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan. We might
assume that A-kàn-kàn is more widely used in Taiwan than in Mainland China.
But we also found the following examples of A-kàn-kàn in the BCC corpus, which
includes mostly data from Mainland China. This suggests that A-kàn-kàn is
acceptable for and used by at least some Mainland Chinese Mandarin speakers
as well.

Fan (1964), Arcodia et al. (2014) and Xie (2020) compare the AA,
ABAB and AABB forms of reduplication and find a number of differences
between the AA, ABAB forms compared to the AABB form in terms of
their semantics, productivity, syntactic distribution and origin. Specifi-
cally, Arcodia et al. (2014: 17–18), Melloni & Basciano (2018: 144) and
Xie (2020: 90) identify that AA and ABAB have a diminishing meaning,
namely that the event happens for a short duration or to a small extent.
By contrast, AABB expresses an increasing meaning, which indicates a
repetition or an action in progress (compare (3a) and (3c)). Xie (2020:
Sec. 3.1) also finds that AA and ABAB have relatively high productivity,
whereas the productivity of AABB is low. She further shows that AABB
is generally correlated with the lack of a postverbal object, but the direct
object remains present when a transitive verb undergoes AA or ABAB
patterns of reduplication. Fan (1964: 277) proposes that AA, ABAB
originated from the verb-measure word combination from Middle Chinese,
while AABB developed from the reiterative rhetoric from Old Chinese.
These differences seem to suggest that there is a fundmental difference
between these two groups of verbal reduplication. The current study will
only focus on the AA, A-yi-A, A-le-A, A-le-yi-A, ABAB and AB-le-AB
forms of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. AA-kàn, A-kàn-kàn,
AAB, A-yi-AB, A-le-AB will also be mentioned occasionally to provide
further arguments. In what follows, the term reduplication will be used to
refer specifically to the AA, A-yi-A, A-le-A, A-le-yi-A, ABAB and AB-le-
AB forms, if not specified otherwise.DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 5
2.2. Syntactic distribution
The reduplication has a similar syntactic distribution as an unreduplicated
verb (5)–(9).

a resultative compound. This runs counter to exiting literature on this subject
which consistently maintains that resultative compounds are not amenable to
reduplication.6

Sui & Hu (2016) claim that the syntactic distribution of the deliminative
reduplication is subject to the following constraints. First, Sui & Hu
(2016: 319, 332) claim that reduplication cannot appear in a relative clause
without a modal verb or a verb with a modal or mood meaning, such as
dǎsuàn ‘plan’, ràng ‘let’ and jiào ‘ask’, providing the contrast in (10) as an
example.

‘The question that the students need to discuss (again) is
very important.’
This claim can be falsified by corpora examples such as (11), where
reduplication occurs in relative clauses without modal or mood verbs. We
thus consider the contrast in (10) a matter of providing a proper context.DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 7

‘They are jazz fans who wandered in to have a listen.’
Secondly, Sui & Hu (2016: 319) show that the reduplication cannot
co-occur with a duration or a frequency phrase (12).
(12) (a) zhè

As we will show in Section 2.3.4, this can be explained by the redundant
semantics of the reduplication and duration and frequency phrases.
Thirdly, Sui & Hu (2016: 319) note that reduplicated verbs cannot be
aspect marked (13).
(13) (a) wǒ
I
(b) * wǒ
I
kàn-le/guo/zhe

‘I read/have read/am reading this book.’

zhè

However, as shown in (5b), le can occur in between the reduplicated verb
and expresses the perfective aspectual meaning, that the event denoted by
the sentence is realized. Thus, we argue that the reduplication can in fact
be aspect marked, but only by le ‘pfv’ but not the other aspect markers.
As we will argue in Section 2.3.3, this is also not a syntactic but a semantic
constraint.
Sui & Hu (2016: 319) further claim that the reduplication cannot be
embedded under negation. But (14) shows that this is not the case.8

Finally, Sui & Hu (2016: 322) claim that a reduplicated verb cannot
combine with a quantized object. However, examples in (15) prove
otherwise.
(15) (a) tā

One reviewer suggests that Sui & Hu’s (2016: 322) claim only holds true for
accomplishments, not activities. Since a quantized object only make accom-
plishments but not activities telic, the acceptability of (15) is expected
(more on the semantics of reduplication will be discussed in Section 2.3).
However, we also find examples of reduplicated accomplishments followed
by quantized objects in CCL and BCC, as shown in (16).

‘The communication between men is relatively fast, … they just

In sum, we consider that the reduplication has a similar syntactic
distribution as an unreduplicated verb, and the incompatibility of the
reduplication with duration and frequency phrases as well as aspect markers
other than le can be explained semantically, as we will show in the next
section.
2.3. Semantics
As shown in Section 1, the reduplication seems to be connected to certain
aspectual properties. The current study adopts the two-component aspect
model proposed by Xiao & McEnery (2004) based on Smith (1991).
The general term “aspect” is considered to encompass the following two
components: situation aspect, i.e. “aspectual information conveyed by
the inherent semantic representation of a verb or an idealized situation”
(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 21); and viewpoint aspect, i.e. “the aspectual
information reflected by the temporal perspective the speaker takes in
presenting a situation” (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 21). Situation aspect can
be further modeled as verb classes at the lexical level and situation types
(the interaction of verb classes and other constituents, such as adjuncts)
at the sentential level (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 33). The verb classes
are determined with verbs in a neutral context (preferably in a perfective
viewpoint aspect, with a simple object only when it is obligatory), where
everything that might change the aspectual value of a verb is excluded
and only the inherent features of the verb itself are considered (see Xiao &
McEnery 2004: 52 for more details). This does not rule out the fact that the
same verb may express different aspectual properties in other contexts, but
its verb class remains the same, as the aspectual change can be attributable
to other components at the sentential level.
In this section, we will first discuss the core meaning of the reduplication
as well as the meaning of its different forms (Section 2.3.1). We will
then investigate the interaction of the reduplication with verb classes (Sec-
tion 2.3.2), aspect markers (Section 2.3.3) and other sentential components
(Section 2.3.4) .
2.3.1. Core meaning
The reduplication has a delimitativeness meaning (e.g. Chao 1968: 204–
205; Li & Thompson 1981: 232; Li 1996: 14; Dai 1997: 70; Zhu 1998:
382–383; F. Xing 2000: 420–421; Q. Chen 2001: 48; Tsao 2001: 288;
Yang 2003: 11–12; Xiao & McEnery 2004: Sec. 4.3). To be specific,
the reduplication of [+durative] verbs reduces the duration of the events,10
and the reduplication of [−durative] verbs reduces the iteration frequency
of the events (Li 1996: 14; Xiao & McEnery 2004: 149–150). Besides
delimitativeness, Chao (1968: 204), Fan (1964: 276), Smith (1991: 356;
1994: 199–120), Li (1996: 14) and Tsao (2001: 290–291) suggest that the
reduplication signifies tentativeness, which can be used “to refer modestly
to one’s own activities, or for mild imperatives” (Smith 1991: 356), or
“trying to” do something (Li & Thompson 1981: 234). Frequentativeness
or habitualness, that the event denoted by the verb happens frequently or
habitually, is mentioned by Fan (1964: 276), Li (1996: 15) and Qian (2000:
1) as the meaning of reduplication as well. Fan (1964: 276) further proposes
a meaning of slightness or casualness for reduplication, which implies that
the event is unimportant or conveys a casual attitude of the speaker. Zhu
(1998: Sec. 3.1.3) suggests that the main function of reduplication is to
increase the agency of the action or the change denoted by the verb.
In general, all of the above cited research agree that the reduplication
expresses a short duration and/or a low frequency, which fits the definition
of delimitativeness. Xiao & McEnery (2004: 152–154) and Yang (2003)
argue that the core meaning of reduplication is delimitativeness, while all
other meanings are merely pragmatic extensions in specific contexts. Xiao
& McEnery (2004: 152–154) points out that tentativeness and casualness
are constrained by a number of contextual elements such as the reduplicated
verb must be volitional and the subject of the sentence must be animate.
But these constraints are only necessary but not suﬀicient conditions for
a tentative or casual meaning of reduplication. Among all instances of
verbal reduplication they found in a corpus, all of them have a delimitative
reading, while only some of them convey tentativeness or casualness.
Yang (2003) compares the sentence pairs with reduplicated verbs and
their unreduplicated counterparts, and shows that the reduplication itself
does not add a tentative, frequentative, casualness or increased agency
meaning to the sentence. Rather, these additional meanings arise from the
sentences or the contexts as a whole. She concludes that these additional
meanings are results of meaning extensions of delimitativeness in specific
contexts. We follow Xiao & McEnery (2004) and Yang (2003) and treat
delimitativeness as the central meaning of reduplication, and the other
meanings as pragmatic extensions.
The semantics of the reduplication has the properties of transitoriness,
holisticity and dynamicity (Dai 1997: 70–79; Xiao & McEnery 2004: 155–
159). It presents the situation as a transitory and non-decomposable whole.
A situation expressed by a sentence with the reduplication involves changes
not only in the initiation and termination of an event, but also in the
transitory process itself. Compared to (17a), which could mean that the
protagonist kept staring at the the footprint, (17b) indicates that the
protagonist took a brief look or several brief looks at the footprint and
looked away in the end, which is a process full of changes.DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 11

crime was committed.’
The semantics of A-le-A can be deduced compositionally from its
structure. It is a hierarchical combination of the perfective aspect and
delimitativeness, “conveying a transitory event which has been actualized”
(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 151).
As for A-yi-A, Fan (1964: 273) compares examples found in novels and
plays and concludes that A-yi-A has exactly the same meaning as its AA
counterpart. She thus assumed that AA is merely a form of A-yi-A, where
the yi is omitted phonologically. F. Xing (2000: Sec. 5) considers that the
major difference between AA and A-yi-A lies in the speaker’s attitude. The
former conveys a casual attitude whereas the latter sounds more serious.
However, he stresses that there is no difference in the delimitative semantics
of both forms, and that the variance in meaning is a pragmatic one. The
difference is also not absolute and often only shows a tendency. Xu (2002)
finds out that compared to A-yi-A, one tends to use AA in contexts with
strong emotional attitudes, urgent, casual, timid or uncertain contexts. But
he also states that these differences are pragmatic rather than semantic, as
he argues that AA and A-yi-A can be used interchangeably in most cases,
and the differences in meaning only arise from specific contexts as a whole.
Yang (2003: 15) suggests that AA and A-yi-A have the same core meaning,
while A-yi-A implies a slightly more serious attitude than AA due to its
length. We assume A-yi-A to be a form of reduplication and that it has
the same core semantics as AA.
AA-kàn and A-kàn-kàn are described to express a “try … and find
out” meaning (Cheng 2012: 63). Tsao (2001: 290) also observes that
the tentative meaning is particularly prominent when the reduplication is
followed by kàn ‘look’. We still consider the tentativeness implied by these
two forms to be a pragmatic extension of delimitativeness. The tentative
meaning is made prominent by the verb kàn ‘look’, and the whole structure
can be understood as “do A a little bit and see”.12
2.3.2. Interaction with verb classes
Previous research often claims that the reduplication can only be used for
certain verb classes, while it is infelicitous for other ones. Li & Thompson
(1981: 234–235) and Hong (1999: 277–278) suggest that reduplication is
only possible for volitional activity verbs. Dai (1997: 70–71) and Tsao
(2001: 290) both consider that reduplication can only be used in dynamic
situations. The former further claims that achievement verbs cannot be
reduplicated. Xiao & McEnery (2004: 155), Arcodia et al. (2014: 20)
and Basciano & Melloni (2017: 145) propose that only [+dynamic] and
[−result] verbs can be reduplicated. This means that the reduplication
can only interact with dynamic situations which encode no results and is
consequently only compatible with activities and semelfactives, but not
with states and achievements.
Q. Chen (2001: 53) and Yang (2003: 10–11) acknowledge that the
reduplication of non-volitional verbs is more restricted than that of
volitional ones. But Zhu (1998: 381–382) lists a number of non-volitional
predicates that can be reduplicated. We found the examples shown in (18)
in CCL where non-volitional verbs wěiqū ‘feel wronged’, rèn-xìng ‘be willful’
and diào ‘drop’ are reduplicated.4

It is true that the reduplication of stative and achievement verbs is not
as easily acceptable as that of activities and semelfactives. Xiao & McEnery
(2004: 155) classify bìng ‘be sick’ as a stative verb. Indeed, compared to
the questionable reduplication of bìng ‘be sick’ in (19a), the reduplication
[4] A reviewer notes that verbs depicting events not controlled by an agent sometimes
can undergo reduplication, especially in imperative, conditional, or causative
sentences. It is worthwhile to delve into why such sentence structures enable
reduplication for these verbs. It is also worth noting that the sentences in (18) are
not imperative, conditional or causative sentences. This shows that non-volitional
verbs can also be reduplicated outside of the aforementioned sentence structuresDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 13
of the activity verb kàn ‘watch’ in (19b) and that of the semelfactive verb

However, examples such as (20) can be found where bìng ‘be sick’ is

As a reviewer points out, Tham (2013: Sec. 3.3) considers bìng ‘be sick’
to be a basic change of state (COS) verb, i.e. ‘become sick’. In contrast, she
uses xǐhuān ‘like’ and xiāngxìn ‘believe’ as examples of stative verbs. Peck
et al. (2013: 680) also list xǐhuān ‘like’ and xiāngxìn ‘believe’ as stative
verbs. For these two verbs, examples such as (21) and (22) can be found.

On the other hand, as the reviewer and indeed Tham (2013: 669–
670) herself note, verbs expressing psychological states such as these
can have a COS interpretation (but not necessarily), let us look at
other examples of stative verbs listed by Peck et al. (2013: 680) which
do not express psychological states, and examples in Xiao & McEnery
(2004: Sec. 3.3.3) of individual-level states (ILSs) which only have stative14
interpretation, as opposed to stage-level states (SLSs) which can have both
stative and dynamic interpretations.5 The following examples contain the
reduplication of xiàng ‘look like’ and zài-chǎng ‘be present on the scene’.
(23) Context: Wáng Shèngdí is the actor of the character Gù Miǎo in a

One might argue that even in the examples above, dynamic rather than
stative meaning is conveyed. We argue that the dynamic interpretation
does not come from the verb but from reduplication. The use of
reduplication affects the situation aspect at the sentential level. And as we
describe in Section 2.3.1, the semantics of reduplication has the property
dynamicity. Verbs such as xiàng ‘look like’ and zài-chǎng ‘be present on the
scene’ are stative in a neutral context and thus, we consider the intrinsic
feature of these verbs to be stative and they should be classified as stative
verbs. The dynamic interpretation only arises when they are used in specific
contexts, in this case, when they are reduplicated.
Similar to stative verbs, the reduplication of achievement verbs is also
not readily acceptable, as shown in (25) with reduplication of yíng ‘win’.

(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 155)
However, examples such as those in (26a–c) can be found. Here, achieve-
ment verbs like wàng ‘forget’ and shēng ‘give birth to’ are reduplicated.
[5] Note that most examples of ILSs in Xiao & McEnery (2004: Sec. 3.3.3) are
adjectives. Since in Mandarin Chinese, adjectives have a different reduplication
pattern (see e.g. Tsao 2001: Sec. 2.2, Fan et al. 2015: Sec. 4.1, Sui 2018: Sec. 3),
and further, COS verbs can be systematically derived from adjectives (Tham 2013:
Sec. 3), these predicates are not included in our examples.

The examples presented in this section show that although the redu-
plication does have a tendency to interact with volitional verbs and with
activities and semelfactives due to its dynamic meaning, this is by no means
a rigid constraint, and non-volitional verbs, states and achievements can be
reduplicated in appropriate contexts as well, contrary to common beliefs
in the literature. Thus, a theoretical account of reduplication should not
restrict its use to only certain verb classes.
2.3.3. Interaction with aspect markers
As mentioned in Section 2.2, the reduplication can only be marked by the
perfective aspect marker le but not other aspect markers.8 We believe this
incompatibility to be for semantic reasons.
Xiao & McEnery (2004: Ch. 4) consider le, guo and reduplication to
indicate perfective aspects, as they all view the situation as an inseparable
whole. The perfective aspect marker le is compatible with reduplication
while the experiential aspect marker guo is not. Xiao & McEnery (2004:
128–131) state that le has the semantic feature of dynamicity, since it
“can focus on both heterogeneous internal structures and changing points”
(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 129). It can be combined with a situation with a
[7] Liú, Zhēn. 1963. Cháng cháng de liúshuǐ [Long long water], 72. Beijing: The
Writers Publishing House.
[8] There is no consensus on which elements exactly are considered aspect markers in
Mandarin Chinese. We only discuss the most commonly recognized ones here.16
dynamic internal structure, such as crying in (27a). It can also co-occur
with a situation with a change at a certain time point, such as getting to
know in (27b). As shown in Section 2.3.1, reduplication can also express
dynamicity of both a time point and a time period, just like le illustrated
here. Therefore, le is compatible with reduplication.

‘He got to know the inside information on this matter.’
In comparison, the experiential aspect marker guo cannot co-occur with
a reduplicated verb, because its dynamicity attributes to an “experiential
change” (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 148), namely that a situation has been
experienced historically and that “the final state of the situation no longer
obtains” at the reference time (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 144). Compare
(28a) and (28b), guo in (28a) suggests a change out of the state of being
a soldier, whereas le in (28b) conveys a change into the state of being a
soldier (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 149).

(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 149)
(Xiao & McEnery 2004: 149)
It is clear that guo only indicates a change at the termination of a
situation and cannot express the dynamicity within a situation. Hence,
it is incompatible with the semantics of the reduplication.
Due to the holistic semantics of the reduplication, it is incompatible
with imperfective aspect markers: the durative aspect marker zhe and the
progressive aspect marker zài, as both only focus on a part of the situation
and do not view the situation as a whole (Xiao & McEnery 2004: Ch. 5).
From the illustration above, it seems that due to its semantics,
reduplication can only be marked by le but not the other aspect markers.
2.3.4. Interaction with other sentential components
The reduplication is incompatible with an expression that quantifies the
duration or the extent of the event expressed in the sentence (29) (Li 1998:
83–84; L. Chen 2005: 114–115). This is because the reduplication alreadyDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 17
contains a quantity meaning (Li 1998: 84; L. Chen 2005: 114–115), namely
a short duration or a small extent, which cannot be measured on a concrete
scale (Xiao & McEnery 2004: 155; Sui & Hu 2016: 333). This results from
the properties of reduplication rather than the verb itself, as the verb itself
can be combined with such an expression (29a).

2.4. Word vs. phrase
The literature on reduplication makes different assumptions on whether it
is a morphological or syntactic phenomenon. Chao (1968: Ch. 4), Li &
Thompson (1981: Ch. 3), Dai (1992: Sec. 4.1) and Liao (2014: 4–5) list
reduplication under morphological processes. By contrast, Arcodia et al.
(2014: 23), Xiong (2016), Basciano & Melloni (2017: 146), Yang & Wei
(2017: 229–231), Melloni & Basciano (2018: 330) and Xie (2020) claim it to
be syntactic. This section reviews the arguments in Xie (2020), and applies
tests from Dai (1992: Sec. 7, 1998: Sec. 2.3–2.4) to distinguish words from
phrases in Mandarin Chinese. The results are compatible with a lexical
analysis.
Xie (2020) compares the AA and the ABAB forms of reduplication with
the AABB form and claims that AA and ABAB are syntactic processes
while AABB is morphological. She points out that AA and ABAB behave
differently from AABB in their productivity, possibility of le insertion,
categorial stability, transitivity, and input/output constraints. While AA
and ABAB are highly productive, AABB shows low productivity. Le can
be inserted freely into AA (30) and ABAB (31) but not into AABB (32).

The two groups also have different input and output constraints. Xie
(2020) claims that only dynamic and volitional verbs can undergo AA or
ABAB reduplication (but see Section 2.3.2). In comparison, AABB requires
its input to be a complex verb whose constituents are either synonymous,
antonymous or logically coordinated (36). Moreover, as can be seen in the
translation in (36), the output of AABB has an increasing meaning, i.e. an
event happens repeatedly or continuously, as opposed to the delimitative
meaning of AA and ABAB.

However, a morphological process can be productive, and it does not
necessarily change the category or valency of the input. For instance, the
-able derivation in English is a productive morphological process. Tense
inflections in English such as -ed change neither the category nor the valency
of the input verb.9 Further, if le is considered to be a morphological element
(e.g. Huang et al. 2009: 101–102; Müller & Lipenkova 2013: 246), the
insertion of le does not have to be viewed as a syntactic process either.
It seems that Xie (2020) only shows that AA and ABAB are different
processes than AABB, but not necessarily that the former is syntactic while
the latter morphological.
A reviewer claims that le insertion can be seen as a violation of lexical
integrity, because it is never found in between the two constituents of a
[9] We do not claim reduplication to be either inflection or derivation.20
compound word, but must be placed after the whole unit. For instance,
Her (2006: 1282) claims that the V-gěi sequence cannot be separated and
uses this as evidence for analyzing it as a single lexical item (jì-gěi-le tā
‘send-give-pfv he, sent him’ vs. ? jì-le-gěi tā ‘send-pfv-give he’). In non-
separable VO compounds, le insertion also does not seem to be possible
(guān-xīn-le ‘close-heart-pfv, cared for’ vs. ? guān-le-xīn ‘close-pfv-heart’).
The AABB form of reduplication also only accepts le to its right but not
in between (37).

In respond to this, we found counter-examples that show le insertion in

In any case, since reduplication is not compounding (Sui 2018: 149–
150; Gao et al. 2021 provide psycholinguistic evidence), and the patterns
discussed here constitute a different process than the AABB pattern (see
the discussions above, also Deng 2013: Sec. 4.3, Sui & Hu 2016: Sec. 2,
Sui 2018 and Wang 2023), it is not surprising that le occurs at a different
position.
It is, therefore, necessary to resort to other tests that are intended to
distinguish words from phrases in Mandarin Chinese. For this purpose, Dai
(1992: 32–33, 1998: 117–120) proposes the modification and the expansion
tests.
First, the modification test suggests that subparts of a word cannot be
modified at a phrasal level. This is possible for a VP (40), as the NP inside
of the VP can be modified by e.g. an AP.
(40) kāi
hóngsède
mén
open
red
door
‘open the red door’
In contrast, the individual verbs in reduplication cannot be modified by
an e.g. AdvP. (41) is ungrammatical whether the AdvP is interpreted toDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 21
modify the first or the second verb. This shows that it has nothing to do
with the relative position of the verb and the AdvP.10
(41) * kàn

Second, the expansion test suggests that a phrasal dependent (either a
modifier or an argument) cannot be inserted into a word. This is possible for
a verbal classifier phrase (42), as the object can occur after or in between.
(42) (a) kāi

For reduplication, this is also not possible (43), as the object cannot be
inserted between the two verbs.
(43) (a) kāi-(le)-kāi

‘open the door for a little while’
(b) * kāi-(le)-mén-kāi

The above two tests seem to indicate a lexical analysis for reduplication.
[10] A reviewer questions the rationale for inserting an adverb within the reduplication,
since an adverb also cannot be inserted into a VP consisting of a verb and its
object, as shown below in (1).
(1) * kāi
open
qiāoqiāode
quietly
mén
door
The ungrammaticality of (1) can be explained by the fact that almost all Mandarin
Chinese adverbials are obligatorily pre-verbal (Ernst 2014: 50), as illustrated in
the example below in (2).
(2) (a) tā
he
(b) * tā
he
qiāoqiāode
zǒu-le.
quietly
go-pfv
‘He quietly went away.’
zǒu-le
qiāoqiāode.
go-pfv
quietly
Ernst (2014: 50) mentions that the only possible post-verbal adverbials are
participant PPs (with somebody), manner or resultative V-de constructions as well
as duration and frequency expressions. (42b) shows a case of inserting a frequency
expression into a VP. This suggests that it is possible to insert adverbials into a
VP.
This word order constraint is not a problem for the test in (41), as the adverb
can, in principle, be interpreted as modifying the second verb.22
Cross-linguistically, verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese patterns
more with morphological reduplication (below as reduplication) in other
languages than syntactic reduplication (below as repetition; Gil 2005: 31,
Forza 2016: 1–2).11 Gil (2005: 35–36) considers non-iconicity and having
only two (but not more) copies as suﬀicient but not necessary conditions
for reduplication. He further proposes building one intonational group
as suﬀicient and necessary condition for reduplication (p. 36). All three
conditions are true for verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese (see Sui
2018: 154 on the intonation of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese).
Forza (2016: 9) argues that the substantial difference between reduplication
and repetition lies in the fact that only the former affects grammatical
features such as aspect. This is also the case for verbal reduplication in
Mandarin Chinese.
In sum, we maintain that verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese is
better off analyzed as a morphological phenomenon.
3. Previous analyses
Previous analyses on the reduplication in Mandarin Chinese and in other
languages can be classified into three groups: the reduplication as a verbal
classifier phrase (Section 3.1), as an aspect modifier (Section 3.2), and as a
special reduplication construction (Section 3.3).12 This section will review
these analyses and will discuss their advantages and shortcomings.
3.1. The reduplication as a verbal classifier phrase
Fan (1964), Chao (1968: 205) and Xiong (2016) analyze the reduplication
in Mandarin Chinese as a verbal classifier phrase13. A verbal classifier is “a
measure for verbs of action expresses the number of times an action takes
place”(Chao 1968: 615), such as the cì in (44).
(44) méi
not
chě-guo
yí
tell-exp
one
cì
clf
‘haven’t told lie once’
huǎng
lie
(Chao 1968: 616)
In this analysis, the first element in the reduplication is the actual verb,
the second element is a verbal classifier borrowed from a verb, and yi ‘one’ is
[11] We do not claim that the syntactic analyses of reduplication discussed in Section 3
consider verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese to be syntactic repetition.
[12] The term construction is used here in its general sense, not in the sense of
Construction Grammar.
[13] Alternative terms for verbal classifier: measure for verbs of action in Chao (1968:
615) or cognate object in Chao (1968: 312) and Hong (1999: 263). The verbal
classifier phrase is also termed quantity adverbial in Li & Thompson (1981: 352–
353) or frequency phrase in Huang et al. (2009: 91).DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 23
an optional pseudo-numeral that only has an abstract ‘a little bit’ meaning.
The analysis is syntactic.
The parallel between the reduplication and a verbal classifier phrase is
obvious. Both the reduplication and the verbal classifier phrase serve to
quantify the duration or the extent of a situation. A reduplication structure
can often be paraphrased into a verbal classifier phrase such as yí xià ‘once,
a while’, yí huì ‘a while’, as illustrated in (45).
(45) (a) děng-děng
wǒ.
wait-wait
I
‘Wait for me a little bit.’
(b) děng
wǒ
yí
xià.
wait
I
one
clf
‘Wait for me a little while.’
However, there are several arguments suggesting that the reduplication
cannot be analyzed the same way as a verbal classifier phrase. First, the
verb and the verbal classifier can be separated (46), while the reduplication
cannot (47) (Paris 2013: 269).14

‘Wait for Zhangsan a little bit!’
[14] One reviewer notes that the objects that can be placed in between the verbal
classifier phrase is usually limited to pronouns and proper nouns. We found some
examples from the corpus showing that not only pronouns and proper nouns can
be placed before yí xià ‘once’:
(1) tā

‘He just took a look at the glass and the glass just broke.’
(CCL)
We think it has to do with the length of the object, i.e. shorter objects can be
placed before yí xià ‘once’ while longer ones cannot.
Even if we accept that the object can be only be placed before yí xià ‘once’ in
limited cases, the fact that the object can be placed before yí xià ‘once’ in some
cases but in no cases in between reduplication suggests there is a fundamental
difference between the structure of the two phenomena.24
(b) * nǐ
you
děng
wait

Second, unlike verbal classifiers (48), the yi‘one’in A-yi-A cannot be
replaced by other numerals (49) (Yang & Wei 2017: 299–230).
(48) (a) tā
pāi-le

Third, idioms (50a) lose their idiomatic meaning when used with verbal
classifiers (50b), but maintain their idiomatic meaning with reduplications
(50c) (Yang & Wei 2017: 230–231).15

[15] This applies except when yí xià ‘once’ is used. Because of this exception, one
reviewer suggests that the loss of the idiomatic meaning in (50b) but not in (50c)
may be attributed to the use of the numeral sān ‘three’ in (50b), because if sān xià
‘three times’ is replaced with yí xià ‘once’ in (50b), he/she can still get the idiomatic
interpretation. We suggest that it is not sān xià ‘three times’ that is special, but
it is yí xià ‘once’ that is special. We can replace sān ‘three’ with any number
above two, and the distinction still exist. But yí xià ‘once’ has acquired a duration
reading ‘for a little while’ that is not available to the other event quantifiers formed
by xià, which only have the ‘for X times’ interpretation (Deng 2013: 77, Zhang
2000: 16). We think liǎng xià ‘twice’ is following this tendency, too. In this case,
it is easy to interpret yí xià and liǎng xià not as referring to the actual number
of action taking place, but as duration adverbials as a whole, thus differing them
from “actual” verbal classifier phrases with other numerals.DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 25

Idiomatic: ‘He made a bit of a last-minute effort before the
Based on these observations, it seems inappropriate to view the
reduplication as a kind of verbal classifier phrase.
3.2. The reduplicant as an aspect modifier
A number of studies consider the reduplication to be an element that
modifies the aspectual properties of the base verb (Arcodia et al. 2014,
Basciano & Melloni 2017, Yang & Wei 2017) due to the delimitative
aspectual meaning of reduplication. Travis (1999, 2000) also analyzes the
reduplication in Tagalog as an imperfective aspect marker.
Arcodia et al. (2014) and Basciano & Melloni (2017) analyze the
reduplication within the framework of First Phase Syntax (Ramchand
2008). Ramchand (2008) proposes that an event is comprised of the
following phrases: the causative subevent (initP), the process subevent
(procP) and the result subevent (resP), which are ordered hierarchically, as
illustrated in Figure 1.
16 Dynamic and volitional verbs have the features
[init proc] and are therefore located under init and proc (Arcodia et al. 2014:
24; Basciano & Melloni 2017: 147). Achievement verbs possess the feature
[res] and reside under res (Arcodia et al. 2014: 24; Basciano & Melloni 2017:
147). Stative verbs do not contain a procP (Basciano & Melloni 2017: 152).
Arcodia et al. (2014) and Basciano & Melloni (2017) assume that
the first element in the reduplication is the actual verb, which resides
under init and proc, and that the second element is the copy of the verb,
which resides in the complement position of proc and serves as an event
delimiter. Since the second element occupies the same syntactic position
as resP, it should have complementary distribution with resP and should
thus be incompatible with achievement verbs because of their [res] feature.
Furthermore, if procP does not exist in the event, as in the case of states,
there should be no place for the reduplication either.
This analysis correctly predicts that the reduplication of achievement
verbs and stative verbs is not as easily acceptable as that of dynamic and
volitional verbs (marked by [init, proc] features).
However, as shown in Section 2.3.2, the reduplication of states and
achievements is unusual but not impossible. This suggests that the reduced
acceptability of reduplicated achievement and stative verbs is semantic
rather than structural. Their use is possible in specific contexts and should
not be ruled out syntactically. Consequently, this proposal does not seem
to offer an appropriate account for reduplication.
[16] The present study does not argue for a NP or a DP analysis and simply takes over
the illustration provided in the cited papers.26

Figure 1: Event structure according to Ramchand (2008: 193)
Yang & Wei (2017: 229) endorse the analysis of reduplication as
an aspect marker following the structure of Mandarin Chinese aspects
proposed by Tsai (2008). Tsai (2008) provides the syntactic analysis for
aspect markers in Mandarin Chinese as shown in Figure 2.
17 He observes
the so-called incompleteness effect, namely that a minimal sentence, which
only contains a verb marked by zhe ‘dur’, le ‘pfv’ or wán ‘compl’ and its
arguments, seems incomplete without further sentential elements such as
the sentence final particle le or a temporal adverbial like gāngcái ‘just now’
(51). In contrast, a minimal sentence with a verb marked by zài ‘prog’ or
guo ‘exp’ and its arguments can stand alone (52).

‘Xiaoli was crying/cried just now.’
He thus proposes three aspect positions under TP. zài ‘prog’ and guo ‘exp’
reside under Asp1, while zhe ‘dur’ and le ‘pfv’ under Asp2, as illustrated
in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Structure of the aspectual system in Mandarin Chinese according
to Tsai (2008: 683)
Turning to reduplication, a minimal sentence with reduplication also
seems incomplete (53). Based on this, the reduplicant should reside under
Asp2, as illustrated in Figure 3.

‘He laughed a little, and didn’t speak.’
This analysis would result in a mismatch between syntax and semantics,
in the sense that the aspect markers that belong to the same semantic
group do not occur in the same syntactic position. Even though le ‘pfv’,
guo ‘exp’ and reduplication all mark perfective aspects (Section 2.3.3, Dai
wán can only occur with certain types of predicate. This differentiation does not
play a role for our purpose and will not be further discussed here.28

‘pfv’ and reduplication are under Asp2. Similarly, zài ‘prog’ and zhe ‘dur’
are both imperfective aspects but also occur in different syntactic positions.
In sum, both analyses of the reduplicant as an aspect modifier do not
seem to be convincing.
3.3. Reduplication construction
Fan et al. (2015) provide a unified HPSG analysis for the reduplication
of both verbs and adjectives in Mandarin Chinese. They consider
reduplication to be a morphological process and model it via lexical rules.
They provide the lexical rule (54) for reduplication in general, and further
propose redup-a-lr and redup-v-lr as subtypes of redup-type, as illustrated
in (55) and (56) respectively.19 For them, the reduplication functions
[19] Note that the format in which the lexical rule is given is not the input–output
format usually used for lexical rules in HPSG. Instead it is depicted as a unary
branching phrase structure rule: the input is the daughter on the right-hand side
of the rule. The output is the mother on the left-hand side. The view of lexical
rules as unary branching rules is adopted in most current work on lexical rules
(Briscoe & Copestake 1999, Meurers 2001) despite the notation that is commonlyDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 29

as an intensifier predicate, as represented in the predicate (pred) in
the constructional-content (c-cont). The intensifier_x_rel has
two subtypes: redup_up_x_rel for the amplifiying meaning of adjectival
reduplication and redup_down_x_rel for the delimitative meaning of verbal
reduplication. The orthography is handled separately. The AABB form
for adjectives and the ABAB form for verbs, as well as the AAB form for
V-O compounds, are handled as irregular derivation forms.

This approach provides a unified account for adjectival and verbal
reduplication. Their commonalities are captured by inheritance hierarchies
of the intensifier predicates and the lexical rules. In the case of verbal redu-
plication, A-yi-A is analyzed as an alternative orthographical form of AA.
This correctly captured the intuition that AA and A-yi-A express the same
meaning and only differ from each other phonologically/orthographically
(see Section 2.3.1).

hook is a technical feature for sharing information. ltop and lbl will be
explained in Section 4 below.30
Nevertheless, this analysis has some shortcomings. To begin with,
since the combination with aspect markers is completely forbidden, it is
impossible for this approach to account for A-le-A. Moreover, as verbal
reduplication is considered to express a delimitative aspectual meaning,
it seems unconvincing to assume that there is no aspect information
in its semantics. We consider a semantic explanation as described in
Section 2.3.3 to be more reasonable for ruling out aspect markers other than
le. Furthermore, this account can only deal with monosyllabic reduplication
and handles ABAB and AAB as irregular forms, for the reason that ABAB
and AAB reduplication of AB verbs “are not very productive in Chinese”
(Fan et al. 2015: 102). This is not true. H. Xing (2000: 33), Basciano
& Melloni (2017: 161), Melloni & Basciano (2018: 329) and Xie (2020:
Sec. 3.1) all consider both AA and ABAB to be productive, and H. Xing
(2000: 36) concludes that AAB is productive as well. Thus, these forms
should not be handled as irregular forms, but should be derivable by lexical
rules.
The shortcomings of previous analyses lead us to propose a new analysis
on verbal reduplication with HPSG, that formalizes the phonology of the
reduplication, resolves the problem of yi and preserves the generalization
on aspect marking, as we will elaborate in Section 4.
4. A new HPSG analysis
In this section, we suggest a new lexical-rule-based analysis of aspect
marking and reduplication using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS;
Copestake et al. 2005). MRS is one instance of underspecified semantics as
is currently used in theoretical and computational work in HPSG (Koenig
& Richter 2024: Section 6, Bender et al. 2002: Section 3, Müller 2015:
Section 4.4, Müller 2025: Chapter 5). The advantage of such types
of semantics is that scope relations can be left underspecified. This
way it is avoided that large numbers of analyses are assigned to single
sentences. Instead sentences are paired with underspecified semantic
representations from which various readings can be derived. MRS uses
lists of elementary predications that are connected via pointers. Scope
constraints are represented by statements of domination. This allows for
elegant ways to underspecify scope. The details cannot be discussed here.
The interested reader is referred to Copestake et al. (2005), Koenig &
Richter (2024: Section 6) or for the use of MRS in a grammar of German to
Müller (2025: Chapter 5). In what follows, we will present the elementary
predications with the features assumed in MRS, but leave out handle
constraints to keep things simple.
Like Fan et al. (2015), we assume lexical rules for reduplication. Our
lexical rules are organized in an inheritance network. verbal-reduplication-lr
is the most general type for reduplication lexical rules in this network andDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 31
the implicational constraint in (57) shows the constraints on all structures
of type verbal-reduplication-lr. Such structures take a verb as lexical-
daughter (lex-dtr). The output reduplicates the phonology (phon)
of the input verb with the possibility to have further phonological material
in between. indicates an underspecified list which could be empty or
not.20 A delimitative relation is appended to the relations (rels) value
of the input verb, and it takes the event index of the input verb ( 3 ) as
argument (arg0, …, arg3 are feature names for arguments. The values
are indices or events similar to variables in normal predicate logic.). The
list of relations contains so-called elementary predications. There is no
complicated embedding of relations. Instead each elementary predication
comes with a label (lbl). The label can be used as an argument of another
relation or in scope constraints, which are not provided here to keep things
simple. The feature ltop points to the local top. This is the elementary
predication that is considered the top-most one in the rels list. Other
elementary predications may share the label or have arguments with labels
of other elementary predications. We will discuss an example below when
we discuss the perfective lexical rule. The label of the output ( 2 ) is
identified with the label of the input and with the label of the delimitative
relation, hence delimitative-rel is treated as a modifier. Further relations
can be added at the beginning of the rels list to allow for the additional
perfective meaning in A-le-A and A-le-yi-A. The combination with the
perfective will be elaborated on in the following paragraphs.

The rels list of the output of the lexical rule is the rels list of the daughter
( 1 ) plus a list with one element. Since this element is specified in the
supertype, it is not specified in (58) again.
non-perfective-verbal-reduplication-lr has aa-lr and a-yi-a-lr as direct
subtypes. (60) and (61) show aa-lr and a-yi-a-lr, respectively. As subtypes
of verbal-reduplication-lr illustrated in (57), both inherit the constraints on
the lex-dtr and on the semantics of the output, and because of (58), no
extra material is appended to the rels value of the input verb and the
list containing the delimitative-rel. In addition to the inherited constraints,
aa-lr and a-yi-a-lr specify the phonology of the output differently. aa-lr
determines that the between the two phonological copies in (57) is the
empty list, whereas a-yi-a-lr specifies this list of phonological material as

v-le-lr is a direct subtype of the perfective-lr. perfective-reduplication-
lr inherits from both verbal-reduplication-lr and perfective-lr and has two
subtypes, a-le-yi-a-lr and a-le-a-lr itself. verbal-reduplication-lr is already
presented in (57). We now turn to the constraints on perfective-lr and its
subtypes.
Müller & Lipenkova (2013: 246) propose the perfective lexical rule given
in (62), adapted to the formalization adopted in the current paper. It takes
a verb as lex-dtr and appends ⟨ le ⟩ to its phonology. Further, it accounts34
for the change in semantics by appending the rels value of the input verb
to a perfective-rel.

The event variables ( 3 ) of the input and the output verb are shared. The
ltop of the output of the lexical rule ( 2 ) is the label of the perfective
relation, and this relation scopes over the embedded verb. The handle of
the embedded verb ( 4 ) is the argument of the perfective-rel.
The lexical rule suggested in (62) only explains simple perfective aspect
marking with le, where le immediately follows the verb. But it cannot
account for the perfective aspect marking of a reduplicated verb, as le does
not occur after the reduplication, nor can le be reduplicated together with
the verb. It can only appear between the verb and the reduplicant. In
order to accommodate le marking for both simple and reduplicated verbs,
a general perfective lexical rule as in (63) and a subtype v-le-lr as in (64)
are posited here. Besides adding a perfective-rel in the rels list of the
output as in (62), the perfective-lr in (63) allows an underspecified list to
be appended at the end of the rels list. The phon value of the output
makes it possible for further phonological material to occur both before
and after ⟨ le ⟩.

v-le-lr with all inherited constraints as given in (64) inherits from
perfective-lr and specifies that the first element in the output phon list
is identified with the phon value of the input verb and that nothing else
comes after ⟨ le ⟩. Furthermore, no other list can be appended at the end
of the rels list of the output anymore. This corresponds to the proposal
of Müller & Lipenkova (2013: 246) shown in (62), which accounts for the
simple perfective marking of verbs.

perfective-reduplication-lr inherits from both verbal-reduplication-lr and
perfective-lr. The phon value of the output reduplicates the phonology
of the input verb and states that there is ⟨ le ⟩ in between, as well as
potentially further phonological material. The rels list of the output
appends the delimitative-rel to the perfective-rel and the rels value of36
the input verb. The arguments of both perfective-rel and delimitative-rel
share the event index of the input verb ( 3 ) to ensure that they apply to
the same event denoted by the input verb. The label of the delimitative-rel
and the input verb are identified (delimitative-rel is a modifier) and this
shared label is embedded under the perfective-rel.

For example (66), we get the MRS representation in (67), where h1 and h2
correspond to the handles 2 and 4 and e1 to the event variable 3 :
(66) tā
he
cháng-le-cháng
taste-pfv-taste
tāng.
soup
‘He tasted the soup a little bit.’
(67) h1 ⟨ h1:perfective(e1,h2), h2:taste(e1,he,soup), h2:delimitative(e1) ⟩
So the delimitative relation is treated as an adjunct to the main relation
of the verb, and the perfective relation scopes over both the main relation
and the delimitative relation.
Two subtypes of perfective-reduplication-lr are posited: a-le-yi-a-lr
and a-le-a-lr, as shown in (68). They take over the semantic change
to the input from perfective-reduplication-lr, but specify the phon value
differently. Specifically, a-le-yi-a-lr specifies the middle phonological
material as ⟨ le, yi ⟩, while a-le-a specifies it as ⟨ le ⟩ only.21
[21] A reviewer wants to know what prevents phonological material other than yi and
le to appear in between the reduplicated elements. He/she states that this aspect
seems to be somewhat arbitrary, and it is not evident why certain elements areDELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE (68) (a) a-le-yi-a-lr ⇒

permissible while others are not.
le ‘pfv’ marks the perfective aspect. The reason for le ‘pfv’ being the only
aspect marker compatible with reduplication is explained in Section 2.3.3.
As for yi ‘one’, its use stems from the historical development of delimitative
verbal reduplication but is synchronically opac. Zhang (2000: 13–15) shows
that delimitative verbal reduplication originates from the “V + numeral + verbal
classifier” phrase, where the verbal classifier is borrowed from a verb of the same
form, as shown in (1) from Sòngdài juàn: Xūtáng Héshang yǔlù [The Song dynasty
volume: Quotations from Abbot Xutang] p. 387 as cited in Zhang (2000: 12).

Here the numeral refers to the actual number of the action taking place and can
be any number. This evolved into the structure of V-yi-V (or A-yi-A), which does
not express the actual number of the action anymore, but simply conveys that the
action happens in a short period of time or for only few times. Consider (2) from
Sòngdài juàn: Zhāng Xié zhuàngyuán [The Song dynasty volume: Top graduate
Zhang Xie] p. 519 as cited in Zhang (2000: 13).

‘(Let me) just take a rest and go sit on the ground.’
In this case, yī ‘one’ cannot be replaced by other numerals. Since V-yi-V does not
express the actual number of the action anymore, it became possible to delete the
yī ‘one’, hence the use of the VV (or AA) form, too.
Synchronically, A-yi-A has the same meaning as AA and both do not refer to
the actual number of the event denoted by the verb. This means that yī ‘one’ in A-
yi-A does not contribute any specific meaning to the structure and is only there as
a historical remnant. In this sense, yī ‘one’ appearing in between the reduplication
is synchronically arbitrary.
Besides the obvious conceptual reason that yī ‘one’ is taken to mean ‘little/few’,
there might be a phonological explanation for yī ‘one’ rather than other numerals
is used in the A-yi-A structure. In Mandarin Chinese, one form of intensifying
reduplication is A-li-AB e.g. hú-li-hútú ‘confused-li-confused’, where the li is fixed
and also does not bear any meaning. Sui (2018: 137) assumes that this syllable
is filled with li because the open syllable li is a relatively unmarked phonological
constituent (Yip 1992) and the second syllable in A-li-AB occupies an unstressed
position. We can see the similarities between li in A-li-AB and yi in A-yi-A: they
are both relatively unmarked and occupies an unstressed position. This can also
make it easier for yī ‘one’ rather than other numerals to become part of a fixed
structure. But a phonological account is out of the scope of this paper and has to
be left for further research.
The subtypes of verbal-reduplication-lr (61, 68) prevent phonological materials
other than ⟨ le ⟩ and ⟨ yi ⟩ from appearing in between the reduplication by
specifying what can appear in the list and what not.38

Figure 5: Analysis of cháng-le-cháng taste-pfv-taste ‘taste the soup a little
bit’
The figure shows how the lexical item for cháng ‘to taste’ is inserted
as a daughter into the a-le-a-lr lexical rule. The arguments of cháng ‘to
taste’ are represented within the spr and the comps list (see Ginzburg &DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 39
Sag 2000 for English) and the respective argument NPs are linked to the
arguments of taste: the subject is arg1, the agent, and the object is arg2,
the stimulus. See Davis et al. (2021) for more on linking. The part of speech
of the lexical item (verb) and the valence information is carried over from
the daughter to the mother unchanged. The semantic contribution of the
daughter verb, the value of 5 , is inserted into the rels list of the mother as
it was specified in the constraints on the type perfective-reduplication-lr in
(65). The phon value of the mother is the concatentation of cháng, le and
cháng, as specified in the constraint on a-le-a-lr in (68b). The resulting
unit cháng-le-cháng then combines with its object forming a VP. This VP
is combined with the subject resulting in a complete verbal projection, a
sentence. cháng-le-cháng behaves in the same way as the simple cháng.
Since the above-described lexical rules do not constrain the number
of syllables of the input verb, but simply reduplicate its phonology as a
whole, they can also account for the ABAB and the AB-le-AB forms of
reduplication, as long as the input verb is disyllabic. Notice that the lexical
rules above also produce AB-yi-AB and AB-le-yi-AB for disyllabic input
verbs. Although these forms are considered unacceptable by some authors
(Li & Thompson 1981: 30; Hong 1999: 275–276; Basciano & Melloni 2017:
160; Yang & Wei 2017: 239), Fan (1964: 269) and Sui (2018: 143) consider
AB-yi-AB and AB-le-yi-AB to be possible, even though they both recognize
that these two forms are rare. Indeed, a few examples of AB-yi-AB and AB-
le-yi-AB in Early Mandarin (69a–b) and Modern Mandarin (69c–f) were
found.

This suggests that even though AB-yi-AB and AB-le-yi-AB might
be degraded, they are not ungrammatical per se. The reason for this
degradedness is probably phonological, since AB-yi-AB and AB-le-yi-AB
contain too many syllables (Fan 1964: 274; Zhang 2000: 15; Yang &
Wei 2017: 239; Sui 2018: 143), but we argue that it is not an issue of
grammaticality. Thus, they can still be produced via the lexical rules
posited above, but are ruled out or degraded due to a general phonological
constraint.27
AAB, A-yi-AB, A-le-AB, AA-kàn and A-kàn-kàn can also be accounted
for by the lexical rules proposed in this section. They can be analyzed
as compounds consisting of a reduplicated monosyllabic verb and another
element. Specifically, AAB, A-yi-AB and A-le-AB can be considered as
the compound of a reduplicated monosyllabic verb (A) and a noun (B).28
AA-kàn can be regarded as the compound of a reduplicated monosyllabic
verb (A) and the verb kàn ‘look’, whereas A-kàn-kàn is the compound of
a monosyllabic verb (A) and the reduplication of kàn ‘look’. A-yi-A-kàn is
also possible, though rare, presumably also due to its length. An inquiry
in CCL found 55 hits of A-yi-A-kàn. A sample is listed in (70).

 One reviewer suggests that given that AB-yi-AB and AB-le-yi-AB were possible
in previous stages of the language (see Zhang 2000: 15, Basciano & Melloni 2017:
160–161), these rare occurrences can be seen as relics of this usage.
[28] Huang (1984: 64–65) and Her (1996: Sec. 2; 2010: Sec. 3.1) argue that some of
these V-O combinations are compounds, some are phrases, and some have dual
status (both compounds and phrases). Following this approach, AAB, A-yi-AB
and A-le-AB can (also) be considered as the phrasal combination of a reduplicated
verb and its object.DELIMINATIVE VERBAL REDUPLICATION IN MANDARIN CHINESE 41

Due to the prominent tentative, trying meaning of AA-kàn and A-
kàn-kàn, they are not compatible with the perfective aspect marker le
semantically, as one usually cannot try something that is already realized.
Thus, structures such as A-le-A-kàn and A-kàn-le-kàn are considered
pragmatically infelicitous.
The current analysis provides a unified account for all forms of
delimitative verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. Like in Fan et al.
(2015), yi is handled as a phonological element which does not make any
contribution to the semantics, and an inheritance hierarchy is used to
capture the commonalities among different forms of reduplication. But
the present proposal also reflects the connection between the reduplication
and aspect marking via multiple inheritance. This account makes use
of a semantic mechanism, which correctly rules out aspect marking with
forms other than le. By providing a semantic explanation, this mechanism
seems less ad hoc than the one used in Fan et al. (2015), which simply
assumed that the reduplication cannot combine with aspect information.
The present approach also has a broader coverage of the forms of verbal
reduplication than the one in Fan et al. (2015). Furthermore, all the forms42
are derivable from the lexical rules proposed here, so that there is no need
to resort to irregular lexicon entries, and the productivity of these forms is
correctly captured. In sum, the analysis proposed in this paper possesses
greater explanatory power and resolves the problems of previous studies.
5. Conclusions
The current study provides a new HPSG account for delimitative verbal
reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. We present empirical evidence that
reduplication is possible with all verb classes. We give a semantic
explanation for the incompatibility of reduplication with aspect markers
other than le. We argue that reduplication is better analyzed as a
morphological rather than a syntactic process. We model reduplication
as a lexical rule, and the different forms of reduplication are captured in an
inheritance hierarchy using underspecified lists. The interaction between
verbal reduplication and aspect marking is handled by multiple inheritance.
This analysis is compatible with both mono- and disyllabic verbs, so that
all productive forms of reduplication are derivable by lexical rules. The
analysis is implemented as part of a computer-processable grammar of
Mandarin Chinese.
